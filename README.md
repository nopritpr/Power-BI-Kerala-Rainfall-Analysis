## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Maps, line/area charts, decomposition trees, and slicers for deep data exploration.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Raw historical data cleaned and prepared in Power Query.
- **Custom DAX Metrics:** Year-over-year changes, seasonal averages, and flood event analysis.
- **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive navigation with cards, KPIs, and dynamic filters.
